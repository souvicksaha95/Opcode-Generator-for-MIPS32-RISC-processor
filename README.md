# Opcode-Generator-for-MIPS32-RISC-processor
This python script will help you to get the machine code of corresponding op-code for MIPS 32 RISC processor. Look into the other repository about modeling this particular processor in verilog. Not all instructions are enabled here. However, you can add other instructions to the json file and modify the code accordingly.   
Following is an example.
